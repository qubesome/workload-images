workloads/cli-llm/Dockerfile installs claude into the target container, but fails to correctly set the PATH. When running the container I need to type the following command to be able to run claude. Fix this on the Dockerfile so that PATH is always correct.  export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

---

Now lets add `claude --version` after its installation, to ensure it is working and fail during build otherwise.
